What is importabt in this project:
-General UI/UX Features
-Animated transitions between pages.
-Feedback images triggered by each action.
-Alarm status: If an alarm is active, display "ALARM" with a red background on all pages.

-- Additional Menu Icons --

The menu should display four small icons:

Alarm status – Lock icon indicating alarm ON/OFF.
Mute status – Mute icon if TV or music is muted.
Temperature – Room temperature display with a snowflake icon if AC is on.
Power status – Power icon for the TV (quick toggle to turn it off).

Again this is just the graphic part and no need to do any functionalities except the transition between pages
